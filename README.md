# semantic-markup

The goal of this assignment was to increase accessibility by using semantic HTML and improve the CSS through refactoring.

These are the changes that were made to the original code:

HTML Changes: Title changed to Horiseon, header element fixed, footer element fixed, nav element added, added main element for content, added aside element, added article elements, added figure element for image, added Alts for images.

CSS Changes: Consolidated benefit, benefit H3s, and benefit img. Consolidated search engine social, imgs, and H2s.
